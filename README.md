# Autocomplete
An autocompleting college search widget in two themes, viewable @ http://kimcoop.github.io/niche-autocomplete

### Tools
JavaScript, jQuery, Sass, GruntJS, RequireJS. I have Grunt running watch + LiveReload, Compass for Sass compilation, JSHint, and RequireJS optimization

### JS Libraries
- John Resig's [Microtemplating Utility](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/)
- Ben Alman's [Tiny Pub/Sub](https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-tiny-pubsub)

### Notes
Since this is a demo, there are a couple things I skipped out on:
- Tests !
- Better browser compatibility (made for Chrome, but functional on Safari & FF)
- Better mobile UI
- Breaking out file structure more (common Sass vars into shareable file, more folders for JS components, etc)
